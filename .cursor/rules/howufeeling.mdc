These rules serve as context to always keep in mind:
- We are using `react-router` for routing. It is part of new react-router v7
- We are using MaterialUI (MUI) components for all the UI and styling
- This codebase is solely frontend, backend powered by firebase and all backend communication implemented via respective services. We utilize real-time connections and caching to save firebase requests. We have no firebase functions and we are not planning on using them
- For animations, we have `framer-motion` installed.
